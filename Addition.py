"""
Addition: One common problem when prompting for numerical input
occurs when people provide text instead of numbers. When you try to convert
the input to an int, youâ€™ll get a ValueError. Write a program that prompts for
two numbers. Add them together and print the result. Catch the ValueError if
either input value is not a number, and print a friendly error message. Test your
program by entering two numbers and then by entering some text instead of a
number.

try:
    num1 = float(input("Enter the first number: "))
    num2 = float(input("Enter the second number: "))
except ValueError:
    print("Invalid input. Please enter valid numbers.")
else:
    sum = num1 + num2
    print("The sum of the two numbers is:", sum)
