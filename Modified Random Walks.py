"""
Modified Random Walks: In the RandomWalk class, x_step and y_step are
generated from the same set of conditions. The direction is chosen randomly
from the list [1, -1] and the distance from the list [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]. Modify the
values in these lists to see what happens to the overall shape of your walks. Try
a longer list of choices for the distance, such as 0 through 8, or remove the âˆ’1
from the x or y direction list
