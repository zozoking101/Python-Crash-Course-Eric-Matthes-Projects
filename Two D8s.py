"""
Two D8s: Create a simulation showing what happens when you roll two
eight-sided dice 1000 times. Try to picture what you think the visualization will
look like before you run the simulation; then see if your intuition was correct.
Gradually increase the number of rolls until you start to see the limits of your
systemâ€™s capabilities.
