"""
Cars: Write a function that stores information about a car in a dictionary.
The function should always receive a manufacturer and a model name. It
should then accept an arbitrary number of keyword arguments. Call the function
with the required information and two other name-value pairs, such as a
color or an optional feature. Your function should work for a call like this one:
car = make_car('subaru', 'outback', color='blue', tow_package=True)
Print the dictionary thatâ€™s returned to make sure all the information was
stored correctly.

def make_car(manufacturer, model, **kwargs):
    car_info = {
        'manufacturer': manufacturer,
        'model': model
    }
    car_info.update(kwargs)
    return car_info

# Example usages
car = make_car('subaru', 'outback', color='blue', tow_package=True)
print(car)

car_1 = make_car('Tesla', 'Model 3', color='red', autopilot=True, premium_interior=True)
print(car_1)

car_2 = make_car('Ford', 'Mustang', color='yellow', convertible=True, engine='V8', year=2022)
print(car_2)
